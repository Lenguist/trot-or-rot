Thought for a second
Below is a draft ROBOTREADME.md that provides context and instructions for another instance of ChatGPT (or any collaborator) to pick up the project easily and continue. This README summarizes the current project structure, goals, and the roles of different scripts and files, as well as the reasoning and decisions behind them.

ROBOTREADME.md
Project Overview
Trot-or-Rot is a project aiming to build a quadruped robot from scratch and teach it to walk. We leverage physics simulation (PyBullet) to develop and refine walking gaits before transferring them to a real hardware robot. The name "trot-or-rot" humorously reflects the challenge: will the robot achieve a stable trot, or end up rotating/falling uncontrollably?

This repository contains the following key components:

Simulation environment and robot configuration
A hill-climber based learning algorithm for optimizing gait parameters
Visualization and analysis tools to inspect and understand learned gaits
Our workflow involves:

Defining robot parameters in robot_config.py that match our best guess of the physical robot's characteristics.
Running the simulation and the learning process (hillclimber_learner.py) to find good gait parameters.
After the learner converges, using visualize_best.py to see the resulting gait in action, log data, and plot the robot's performance metrics.
Eventually, once a gait that performs well in simulation is found, we will test it on the real robot. The final goal is to have a gait that transfers effectively from sim to real.

Key Files and Their Roles
robot_config.py:
Defines the physical and configuration assumptions about the robot. These include joint mappings, motor force limits, position/velocity gains, friction, parameter ranges for gait optimization, etc. By editing this file, you can align the simulation to closely match the real robot.

hillclimber_learner.py:
A hill-climber optimization script that evolves a set of gait parameters (currently modeled as a sinusoidal function per joint, but stored generically so it could be expanded to other function types). It:

Prompts the user for notes at the start (helpful for documenting run conditions).
Runs a series of evaluations, mutating parameters and keeping track of the best solution found.
Produces a values.json file storing the best parameters and log_card.txt summarizing assumptions, parameters, notes, and final performance.
Minimizes logging overhead for performance.
visualize_best.py:
After training is done, this script:

Loads the best parameters and their functional definitions from values.json.
Runs a simulation with PyBullet’s GUI turned on, so you can visually inspect the robot’s movements.
Records the robot’s motion data (x, y, z, pitch, yaw, roll, speed) into a CSV file and plots these metrics over time, saving the plot in the analysis directory under the run’s results folder.
The camera view is set to follow the robot closely at a defined angle and distance.
hello-bullet.py:
A simple test script originally used to confirm that PyBullet and its environment are correctly installed and functioning. Not integral to the learning or visualization process, but handy for troubleshooting.

meshes/ and urdf-assembly.urdf:
Contain the robot’s physical model definition. The URDF references the 3D meshes, defines links, joints, and their relations. Adjusting this model updates the robot’s geometry in simulation.

Workflow Summary
Prepare the environment:
Make sure robot_config.py is aligned with the hardware robot’s parameters as best as known.

Run the Hill Climber Learner:

bash
Copy code
python hillclimber_learner.py
When prompted, type in any notes or assumptions. The script will iterate through possible gaits and store the best found parameters.

Visualize and Analyze Results:
Once done, you’ll have a run_<timestamp> directory in results/hillclimber. To visualize:

bash
Copy code
python visualize_best.py --run run_<timestamp>
This opens PyBullet GUI, simulates the final gait, allows you to inspect it visually, and saves analysis data.

Check log_card.txt and values.json:
These files contain a record of what was done, what worked best, and the parameters that define the winning gait. If changes are needed, modify robot_config.py, or the learner code, and rerun.

Future Steps / Continuation
Model Refinement:
Another ChatGPT instance or a developer picking this up could try different gait representations (e.g., multiple sinusoids, piecewise trajectories, or RL-based policies) by changing how hillclimber_learner.py defines joint_functions and evolves parameters.

Sim-to-Real Transfer:
Future tasks might include domain randomization or system identification steps to ensure that what works in simulation also performs well on the real robot hardware.

Extended Logging and Analysis:
Additional metrics can be recorded, such as energy expenditure (torque * joint velocity) or stability metrics, by extending visualize_best.py or adding a new analysis script.

Interaction with Another LLM Instance:
If another instance of ChatGPT or a collaborator picks this up, they have all the context needed right here: what each file does, how the workflow proceeds, and how to run and modify the scripts.
